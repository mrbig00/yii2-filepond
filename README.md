### Filepond options

Filepond options described at the [documentation](https://pqina.nl/filepond/docs/) can be set by setting `instanceOptions` or `settingsOptions`.

This is the preferred way:

```
    <?= FilepondWidget::widget([
            'name' => 'file',
            'instanceOptions' => [
                'required' => true,
                'maxFiles' => 10,
                ... other options ...
            ]
         ]);
    ?>
```

### Filepond plugins ###

If you want to add some of filepond plugins to the widget, set the allow plugin option to `true`. For example, to add file type validation plugin set `allowFileSizeValidation`:

```
    <?= FilepondWidget::widget([
            'name' => 'file',
            'instanceOptions' => [
                'allowFileSizeValidation' => true,
                'maxFileSize' => '10M',
                ... other options ...
            ]
         ]);
    ?>
```

### Validation

Only client-side validation is available. This kind of validation is the part of filepond library. You can add file size and file type validation. Example of file type validation:

```
    <?= FilepondWidget::widget([
            'name' => 'file',
            'instanceOptions' => [
                'allowFileTypeValidation' => true,
                'acceptedFileTypes' => ['image/*']
            ]
                ... other options ...
            ]
         ]);
    ?>
```

### Localization

Original library isn't localized and has only english labels. This widget has russian translations too. To apply the localization you have to set `language` option in `Yii` settings or directly in the widget:

```
    <?= FilepondWidget::widget([
            'name' => 'file',
            'language' => 'ru-RU'
         ]);
    ?>
```
